## 📊 Technical Achievement Highlights

### 🧠 **Intelligent Prediction Algorithms**
```dart
// Weighted cycle length prediction with symptom influence
final adjustedLength = baseLength + symptomAdjustment;
final confidence = (dataQuality * 0.6 + consistency * 0.4);

// Symptom likelihood scoring
final likelihood = math.min(1.0, occurrences / cycles.length);
if (likelihood >= 0.3) { // 30% threshold
  predictedSymptoms[symptom] = likelihood;
}

// Phase-based mood/energy forecasting
moodForecast[phase] = math.max(1.0, math.min(5.0, 
  baselineMood + phaseEffect['mood']));
```
